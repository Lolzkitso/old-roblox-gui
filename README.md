# Old Roblox: Reborn!
> Roblox From 2013-19 remade!

Hello and welcome to my side project: **Old Roblox: Reborn!**
I decided to make this because the old Roblox gui is cool to me, and it's really fun to play with this kind of stuff.

(Currently, only 2015-19 Gui style is done. And, yes, I DID use the old Chat System, (in my own way, since the original ChatService is now depricated and can no longer be used in newer games.)

# Features!

- The ability to use Display Names in the Leaderboard and Chat, or not if you prefer!
- The old chat bubble is included, and can be changed at anytime!
- A setting to have the Player name in Chat be set to a random color on joining, or based on Team Color!
- The old loading Animation! There are currently 2 (Early 2016 & Early 2019!)
- The ability to toggle the Old Gui off and on whenever you want!
- The ability to have forcefields (the lil circle that used to go around the player whenever they respawned) on or off!

# A Quick QnA to make sure of some stuff!

> "Is this a scam and are there any viruses?"

Nope! I made sure to include everything that I said was added! I also triple checked all of the code and there are no hidden backdoors or viruses!

> "Is this truly all of 2013-19 Guis' and feel?"

It's probably not very accurate, but to make sure that I am as close as possible, I have an old version
of Roblox Studio from 2020 on side just incase I forget something important.

> "Does this include Skyboxes and Old Lighting?"

Yes! Unfortunatly, though, in an update, the "Compatability" Lighting setting, used in most games, was retired and, a little while ago, it seems like Lighting settings like ShadowMap and Future were also retired. (Rip ShadowMap & Voxel :(, yall will be missed)

> "Does this contain old code?"

No, since most of the code used back in 2020 or older is now depricated. And I want this to work for newer games aswell that, for example, can't use LegacyChatService.

> "Can you record or take screenshotss?"

I'm pretty sure in Roblox's TOS, it's prohibited to add files to a users' device, so no. But the ui DOES still mimic what will happen when you would take a screenshot or record a video, though.

# Installation!

To install the Old Roblox Gui, first:
- Find the version you want
- Download the Roblox file provided
- Enter Roblox Studio; Enter a game
- Right Click > Insert > Insert From File...
- Import the File, and it should work!

From here you should be done with installing and the file should show up. (If not, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Lolzkitso/old-roblox-gui/issues/new)).

# Credits!
- P0s_0 for creating the old Leaderboard!
