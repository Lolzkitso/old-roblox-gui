# Old Roblox: Reborn!
> Roblox From 2013-19 remade!

Hello and welcome to my side project: **Old Roblox: Reborn!**
And, yes, I DID use the old Chat System, (in my own way, since the original ChatService is now depricated and can no longer be used in newer games as of July 2025.) Menu and Backpack, but not the Main Settings Menu just yet (It'll be out soon, though 
:) )

(Currently, only 2015-19 Gui style is done.)

# Features!

- The ability to use Display Names in the Leaderboard and Chat or not!
- The old chat bubble is included, and can be changed at anytime!
- A setting to have the Player name in Chat be set to a random color on joining, or based on Team Color!
- The old loading Animation! There are currently 2 (Early 2016 & Early 2019!)

# A Quick QnA to make sure of some stuff!

> "Is this a scam and are there any viruses?"

Nope! I made sure to make this as authentic as possible! I also triple checked all of the code and there are no hidden backdoors or viruses!

> "Is this truly all of 2013-19 Guis' and feel?"

It's probably not very accurate, but to make sure that I am as close as possible, I have an old version
of Roblox Studio from 2020 on side just incase I forget something important.

> "Does this include Skyboxes and Old Lighting?"

Yes! Unfortunatly, though, in an update, the "Compatability" Lighting setting, used in most games, was retired and, a little while ago, it seems like Lighting settings like ShadowMap and Future were removed. (Rip ShadowMap :(, you will be missed)

> "Does this contain old code?"

No, since most of the code used back in 2020 or older is now depricated. And I want this to work for newer games aswell, that can't use old chat.

# Credits!
- P0s_0 for the old Leaderboard!
